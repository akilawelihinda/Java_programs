This repo consists of all my Java programs. Unfortunately, I wiped my computer recently and lost most of them, but I'll
be sure to upload the ones that I have. The type of programs you will find here will include: practical programs, project
programs, useful programs, and challenge problem programs. Please don't use my code to cheat on tests or submit as homework
assignments. The reason I upload programs is to share my work, not to dishonestly help others.

List of Programs:

-Scramble ==> Scramble is a simple program that scramble and unscrambles words you enter by using a simple-shift encoding
              algorithm. It is useful to encode sensitive info like passwords, private info, and financial info. Simply
              decide whether you want to scramble or unscramble and enter in the sequence, and the program will give you
              the conversion.
